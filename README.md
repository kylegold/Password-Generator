# Installation

In order to get this project running correctly you will need to download the Password Generator repository which contains a README, the index HTML file which includes the page structure where the password will be generated, the CSS file where the page is style & the Javascript file which handles user alerts, prompts and logic to generate a password which is then display on the webpage to use.

## Usage

The use of this project is to create a random password generator that operates using criteria given to the user to choose from. A user is prompted to choose the length of the password; a number inclusive between 8-128. A user is then prompted to choose 1-4 options: lowercase, uppercase, number, & special character. The password is then generated on the page for the user to use.

## Credits

This javascript file was updated by Kyle Goldfarb.

## License

This project is open to anyone looking for a reference in creating a random password generator with user chosen criteria.

## Your Task

This week’s homework requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
